# libusb-win32
This is imported from libusb-win32 Subversion.

libusb-win32 is now in Bug-Fix-Only maintenance mode. It is recommended new project should migrate to libusb-1.0 API and use libusb Windows (http://libusb.info) instead. For Windows only project, you can also look at libusbK  (http://libusbk.sourceforge.net/UsbK3/index.html)
